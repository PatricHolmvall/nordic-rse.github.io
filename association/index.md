# About Nordic-RSE

The seed of Nordic-RSE started in January 2018, and as of 2020 has
become active.  Nordic-RSE is not yet a legal registered association,
but is working towards that in 2020/2021.  However, that doesn't stop
you from [joining us](/communities/join/) to advocate for research
software and research software engineers anyway.

This section tells about the formal, administrative side of the
Nordic-RSE association.  If you want to help to create this, why don't
you join us?

Currently, Nordic-RSE events are legally backed by the [Nordic
e-Infrastructure Collaboration](https://neic.no) as part of the
[CodeRefinery project](https://coderefinery.org).
