# Nordic-RSE Membership

Since we are not a registered association, there is no formal
membership process.  In the meantime, show your interest by doing one
of these two things:

* Our [map](/map/) lists people interested in the RSE concept in the
  Nordics.
* Our [chat](communities/join/#nordic-rse-chat) contains people
  interested in taking part.

Currently, all memberships should currently be considered *public
information* (and note that, in a (some forms of) registered
association, the membership list is open to all members, thus is
essentially public information anyway).
