## RSE activities in Nordic countries

Research Software Engineering Groups provide a home
for research programmers who collaborate with researchers on multiple
research projects.

In respect to create RSEs network across Nordic countries we are
interested in RSE groups, teams and local research organizations communities.
They may be based in universities or in national labs or research
institutes, and in academic departments or in university IT organisations.

If you are organized in such a group please contact us.
