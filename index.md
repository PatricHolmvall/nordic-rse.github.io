# Nordic Research Software Engineer Group

We bring together the community of people writing and contributing to research
software from Nordic universities, research institutes, companies and other
organizations to share knowledge, to organize meetings, and raise awareness for
the scientific recognition of research software. This initiative is following
the international network of other RSE groups at [UK](https://rse.ac.uk),
[Germany](https://de-rse.org), [Netherlands](https://nl-rse.org/), [United States](https://us-rse.org), and
other countries.


### Want to know more?

- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nordic_rse).
- Join us by subscribing to the [mailing list](https://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/listinfo/nordicrse-discuss).
  By joining the community, you will
  stay in touch with RSEs in the Norway and you can send and receive
  announcements of events organized by and for RSEs. You will also be informed
  about our work and will have the chance to contact people like you from all
  corners of the research world. The more members that we have, the easier it
  will be to raise awareness of the importance of software in research, and the
  vital role RSEs play in creating this software.

## What is a Research Software Engineer?

A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an
intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is
extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system.
This means there is no easy way to recognize their contribution, to reward
them, or to represent their views. Without a name, it is difficult for people
to rally around a cause, so the term Research Software Engineer was created. We
are now working to raise awareness of the role and bring the community
together.

Some Research Software Engineers start off as researchers who spend time
developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work
and have invested in developing specialist skills, they continue to focus on
software and its use in research. Others start off from a more conventional
software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of
using software to further research.

The [attraction of being a Research Software
Engineer](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer)
is similar to that of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to
know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers
to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops,
maintains and extends software to provide the answers.


## Are you a Research Software Engineer?

Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of the following
questions, you are doing the work of a Research Software Engineer:

- Are you employed to develop software for research?
- Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
- Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
- Are you the person who does computers in your research group?
- Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
- Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers
  and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution
  through software?
