# Nordic research software engineers

A **research software engineer** is someone involved in research, but
more focused on the computational skills than publications.
**Nordic-RSE** is the network of these people in the Nordics.  We
currently focus on building a network of RSEs and highlighting their
importance in academic.  For RSEs or people who might want to be one,
we offer opportunities for professional development and career
advancement.

We are modeled on similar international networks in the
[UK](https://rse.ac.uk), [Germany](https://de-rse.org),
[Netherlands](https://nl-rse.org/), [United
States](https://us-rse.org), and other countries.

### What is a research software engineer?

A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an
intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is
extremely valuable, RSEs often lack a formal place in the academic
system: they produce less papers than a researcher, their code is less
formal than a software developers', and career recognition is
correspondingly low.  The term "Research Software Engineer" to attempt
to recognize and promote these people, and the [advantages to being a
RSE are similar to being a
researcher](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer).
A RSE will almost always closely work within researcher.

There are two typical types of RSEs:
* Researchers who tend more towards the tech side, and not primarily
  interested in jobs which depend on numbers of publications.
  Typically titled "postdoc", "graduate student", "staff scientist",
  or some such.
* Tech staff/software developers who like the challenge and freedom of the
  research environment.  Typically titled "Application specialist", "IT
  support", "laboratory manager", "programmer", or some such.

You can read more about RSEs demographics in the Nordics in [our 2018
survey](https://github.com/nordic-rse/RSE_intro_survey).


### Are you a research software engineer?

Most research software engineers don't have that as their job title.  If you answer yes to many of the following
questions, you are doing the work of a research software engineer:

- Are you employed to develop software for research?
- Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
- Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
- Are you the person who does computers in your research group?
- Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
- Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers
  and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution
  through software?
- Are you unsure what your next career step should be?
