# Joining Nordic-RSE

We will soon make it possible to join a list and to list all members and to
plot members on a map with links to Twitter, GitHub/GitLab, personal websites,
and projects.

By joining the community, you will stay informed about our work
and will have the chance to contact people like you from all
corners of the research world. The more members that we have,
the easier it will be to prove the impact of the Research Software
Engineering community and influence the decisions that affect us.


### Join the discussion

- Discuss with other RSEs on the [CodeRefinery chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (nordic-rse stream).
  This is a public chat and everybody is welcome to join. This is the place where we discuss RSE events in the Nordics
  and you are most welcome to open new "topic" threads, ask questions, and network.
- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nordic_rse).
