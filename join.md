### Joining Nordic-RSE

Joining the RSE Community is easy â€“ just sign up to our
[mailing list](https://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/listinfo/nordicrse-discuss).

This is a low-volume mailing list that is moderated and used for
announcements only. You will get notices about events, job postings,
opportunities for collaboration and occasional information about our
campaign.  You will not be sent any spam.

By joining the community, you will stay informed about our work
and will have the chance to contact people like you from all
corners of the research world. The more members that we have,
the easier it will be to prove the impact of the Research Software
Engineering community and influence the decisions that affect us.

### Communication options

Once you have joined, there are several options for getting
involved with the dynamic and friendly Research Software Engineering community:
