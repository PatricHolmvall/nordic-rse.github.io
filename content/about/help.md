# Get involved

## Yourself

We have multiple ways to become involved with Nordic-RSE:

* Become a member [here](/join/) and follow our [calendar](/events/calendar/)
* Join the [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](htttps://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (#nordic-rse stream) 
* Visit any of our coffeebreak or community [meetings](/events/meeting/)
* We also have multiple ever-changing taskforces dealing with the seminar series, other 'one-time' events, website redesign, etc that everyone is very welcome to join.


## As Company / Institute / University

We are currently thinking about how we can best provide and receive help from companies, institutes and universities and will update this page as soon as we can.

If you have ideas on how we could help each other, let us know!
See [contact page](/about/governance/contact/).
