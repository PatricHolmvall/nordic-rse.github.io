# Research Software Engineers


### What is a research software engineer?

A growing number of people in academia **combine expertise in programming with an
intricate understanding of research**. Although this combination of skills is
extremely valuable, RSEs often lack a formal place in the academic
system: they may produce fewer first-author papers than a researcher,
and they may contribute to many papers and not appear as a
author beyond a minor acknowledgement, if that!
Their code is less
formal than a software developers', and career recognition is
correspondingly low.  The term "Research Software Engineer" is an attempt
to recognize and promote these people, and the [advantages to being a
RSE are similar to being a
researcher](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer).
RSEs will almost always closely work with researchers.

You can read more about RSEs demographics in the Nordics in [our 2018
survey](https://github.com/nordic-rse/RSE_intro_survey).


### Are you a research software engineer?

Most research software engineers don't have that as their job title.  If you answer yes to many of the following
questions, you are doing the work of a research software engineer:

- Are you employed to develop software for research?
- Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
- Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
- Are you the person who write research software in your research group?
- Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
- Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers
  and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution
  through software?
