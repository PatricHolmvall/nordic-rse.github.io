# The first Nordic-RSE conference has been canceled


Initially we have planned for October 21-22, 2020 and our attempt to move the conference to May 2021
did not seem realistic enough due to uncertainties around the COVID-19 situation.
**The conference is cancelled**. 

<!--

### Call for proposals

This is the first Nordic-RSE meeting, so we especially welcome a variety of
event types which promote engagement and community building, and are target to
people who don't already identify as RSEs.

Please see the [submissions page](/conference/submissions/) for more information. Call closes
September 15.


### Schedule

We start Tuesday, December 1, 9:15 (registration starts 8:30)
and close Wednesday, December 2, 16:45. For more details, please see the
[tentative schedule page](/conference/schedule/).


### Venue

The venue is the **student union building "Nymble"** at Drottning Kristinas vÃ¤g 15,
Stockholm ([location on OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=59.34727&mlon=18.07057#map=19/59.34727/18.07057)).
This venue has sufficient capacity for 200 people, one large room
and several smaller rooms.  It is located on KTH campus, offers good open
informal areas for mingling during coffee breaks. This is not a "sterile" conference
venue but has an atmosphere.


### Why attending the conference and why getting involved?

When planning this conference we have the following "personas" in mind:

<table class="table">

      <th scope="col">Their interests</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">People who spend a significant portion
                      of their time programming
                      (these are "classic" RSEs)</th>
      <td>- Get recognized for their work</td>
      <td>- Best practices <br>
          - Future career possibilities <br>
          - Collaboration opportunities</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">People with research focus who spend
                      one or two hours per week programming</th>
      <td>- More efficient research</td>
      <td>- Solve immediate problems <br>
          - Learn about best software practices in their domain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">PIs/administrators who can improve
                      their group's/institution's research quality
					  (or those who need to pitch to them)</th>
      <td>- Learn how RSEs can complement their existing staff <br>
          - Learn how to nurture a collaborative, educational computational culture <br>
          - Improve the quality and efficiency of their research</td>
      <td>- Learn about best practices in other groups and institutions <br>
          - Come back prepared to improve their own group/institution</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### What will the program be like?

We plan 3 plenary talks ("What is an RSE?", community building and values, and
research and/or industry perspective), a panel group session where national and regional RSE
groups present and can answer questions, lightning talks, shorter contributed
talks, as well as workshops about tools, training, community building, career
development, and more. For more details, please see the [tentative schedule
page](/conference/schedule/).
