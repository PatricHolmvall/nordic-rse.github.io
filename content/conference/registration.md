# Registration

See the [timeline page](/conference/timeline/) for important dates.
Roughly, registration opens in September and early-bird registration
closes 15 October.  If you want to submit an abstract see the
[submissions page](/conference/submissions/) (acceptances will be
announced before early-bird registration closes).

Tentative prices are 900 SEK (≈90€) early bird and 1500 SEK (≈150€)
regular.

If the conference is canceled due to COVID-19, all registration fees
will be refunded ([COVID-19 decision timeline](/conference/timeline/)).


## We are looking for volunteers!

We are looking for people who would like to get involved and help out
supporting sessions and workshops as volunteers.
It is a great way to meet peers from the RSE community and to support the
Nordic RSE community and this conference.
Please get in touch with the conference organizers
if you would like to contribute as volunteer helper.
