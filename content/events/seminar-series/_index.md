Are you developing software or tools that are driven by research/engineering in either academia or industry? 
Need to network, share knowledge and experiences with your peers? Nordic-RSE invites everyone interested to participate in Nordis-RSE seminars.

The series will start out as a monthly event in August 2021. The time for each seminar will be set by the speaker. We are inviting everyone to suggest topics and/or speakers for this series (link coming soon).

To kick off the event some of our members will introduce you to their work at Nordic universities.

We would like this series to be an informal space also for exchanging ideas and experiences, learning something new, and networking with people of the same interest group. You do not have to be a Research Software Engineer or a Researcher or a Software Engineer nor do you have to be in or be related to the Nordics. Everyone interested in RSE activities is welcome and encouraged to participate!

The Nordic-RSE team will provide support and infrastructure.
