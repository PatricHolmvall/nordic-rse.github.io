[Research Software Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/) is an online
stream/show about scientific computing and research software. It is designed to
provide the skills typically picked up via informal networks: each week, we do
some combination of exploring new tools, analyzing and improving someone's
research code, and discussion.

In this show which we will stream during the Nordic RSE get-together, we will
have a look at the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This can only be joined via Twitch, not breakout rooms.  Join at
<https://www.twitch.tv/RSHour>.  Questions can be asked via a HackMD
link at that page, no account necessary.
