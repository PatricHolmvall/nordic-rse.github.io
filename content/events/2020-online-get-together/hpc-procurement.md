Procuring an HPC system - a.k.a. a supercomputer - is a complex and
multifaceted task. Before sending out the *Request For Proposals* the
procurer needs to quantify requirements along several dimensions and
decide on an acceptable level of risk. Should the tendered system
maximize benefit for existing users and use cases, or should possible
future user communities and emerging HPC workloads be factored in? Do
you prioritize throughput capability or minimizing time to solution
for given workloads? How important are acquisition and running costs
compared to other measures? Are you willing to invest in future
technologies which would require significant refactoring of commonly
used HPC simulation software? Which HPC software should be included in
the benchmarking suite, and how should benchmark results be scored?

This session will start with a walk through of several aspects of an
HPC procurement and will be followed by an open discussion where
participants can share their own experiences. A goal of the discussion
can be to arrive at a set of best practices in HPC procurements.
