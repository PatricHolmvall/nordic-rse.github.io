# Abstract

The [Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology (OCBE)](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/) is a scientific center integrating the activities of the [Department of Biostatistics, University of Oslo](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/about/organization/departments/biostatistics/), and the [Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Oslo University Hospital](https://www.ous-research.no/ocbe/). Our 70+ scientists work together to provide research, teaching, and advising to the scientific community.

In this lightning talk, I share a bit of my experience as the first (and currently only) hired RSE professional.
