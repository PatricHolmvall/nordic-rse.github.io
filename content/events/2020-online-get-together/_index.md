### Proposal submissions

The [abstract submission form](https://indico.neic.no/event/146/) will
be kept open until approximately one week before the event but we encourage
you to submit as soon as possible - even if not perfect.

You can also submit an idea for a contribution to our
[Proposal incubator](https://github.com/nordic-rse/meetups/issues)
as GitHub issue where we can comment on it and collaboratively develop the
idea. This is also an opportunity to find co-authors.

Examples of types of events that can be proposed:

* Lightning talks: (2 minutes)

  Lightning talks are presentations that are limited to a maximum of 2 minutes and no more than 2 slides including
  any title slide. They allow you to introduce your group or give a high-level overview of a project.

* Talks: (20 minutes)

  A regular talk provides the opportunity to go into more detail in presenting your work, a technical idea
  or an example of using a software tool or library. There is also the opportunity to get feedback through
  questions from the audience. The talk it self should be at most 20 minutes and 10 minute will be reserved for
  question and discussion after the talk.

* Reprohacks (120 minutes with break)

  Propose a research paper and try to reproduce the results. There is no better way to learn what
  is needed for reproducible research, and what you might be missing, than to pick a paper and try
  to recreate it. At the workshop we will work in small groups on individual publications and see how far we get.

* Crash Course (60 minutes)

  Run a teaching workshop introducing a useful tool or an interesting theoretical topic. This could
  be a combination of demonstrations, short talks, discussion, panel sessions and so on.

* Discussions or panels (60 minutes)

  Propose a topic of conversation to develop an idea or seek experiences and opinions.
  The submitter should chair the conversation to keep it productive.

* Collaborative blog post (60 minutes)

  A more formal discussion that produces a blog post as an end result.
  Topics would be pitched in advance.

* Other
