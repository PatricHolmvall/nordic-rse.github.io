This was an unconference session, a discussion added to the agenda during the workshop.

#### Questions and comments

 * Special interest groups exist.
   * Do they funnel people out of the main group?
   * Work with them and include the interest groups in the main group
 * What leads to the imbalance at different levels on career / education?
 * Example: Gender balance in computational particle physics in Helsinki surprisingly good. Why?
     * Better balance among students than before
     * Hiring from earlier in the studies (batcherol's level)
     * If related fields are more biased, there are more qualified applicants
 * Hard discussion to have, thanks to everyone who was involved
 * Sorry I forgot to take notes for most of it :(
