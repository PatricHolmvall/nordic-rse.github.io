This was an unconference session, a discussion added to the agenda during the workshop.

 * I havenâ€™t prepared this and maybe it was discussed already somewhere

#### Questions and comments

- May 27 and 28, 2021, Stockholm
- 1 auditorium (150-200), 2 workshop rooms for 30 people and a number of smaller rooms booked
- common social area can be used

suggestions:
- offer different tracks with a good balance
- training tracks: RSE's role as a trainer and supporter
- consider inviting persons from funding agencies ("how can we fund 'invisible' but important work?") +1
  - also university HR/ management; to avoid a too one-sided discussion if only RSEs are in the room 
- invite representatives from other "chapters" to share lessons learned +1
- hearing about/from journals like JOSS +1
- open science should be included as a topic
- interface with CarpentryConnect conference (collocated)
- invite managers and policy makers who *have* success stories in the RSE area +1


theme suggestions:
- "software in research"

how to announce it outside of our "bubble":
- consider calling the press (press offices at Unis)
- at the places where startups advertize
- unions for researchers and engineers
- newsletters via computing centers

technical:
- better many short hackmds rather one long hackmd
