The [EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden (ENCCS)](https://enccs.se/)
was established
on 1 September 2020 with funding from the Swedish Research Council
(https://www.vr.se/english.html), Vinnova (https://www.vinnova.se/)
and the EuroHPC Joined Undertaking
(https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/). ENCCS is one of the 33 national HPC
Competence centers across Europe.

The mission of ENCCS is to develop competence, knowledge and support
in Sweden to enable academic and industrial researchers and high
performance computing (HPC) users to take advantage of both
forthcoming (pre-)exascale EuroHPC resources as well as modern
artificial intelligence and high-performance data analytics (AI/HPDA)
methodologies. 

ENCCS has research software engineers from different backgrounds who
are both training researchers through workshops and hackathons and
supporting selected research software to run on (pre-)exascale
systems. We also work with industry through the [Research Institutes
Sweden (RISE)](https://www.ri.se/) and offer support in writing
EuroHPC-JU systems access proposals.
