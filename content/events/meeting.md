# Nordic-RSE meetings

We meet virtually for the following occasions:

## Virtual coffee break - weekly

[RSE Finland invites](/communities/coffeebreak/#weekly-virtual-coffee-break)

## Community discussions - biweekly 

We meet every other week to discuss the development of Nordic RSE and plan upcoming events. The meeting is on each odd week. Follow the [calendar](/events/#calendar), [chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) or agenda (see below) for exact dates and times, as well as connection details.

The agendas of previous and upcoming meeting are kept on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly).

## Taskforce meetings - randomly

Once in a while we have larger projects that would be too much to discuss in the community meetings. Then we form taskforces that meet separately. Lately we for example formed taskforces on the topics of website redesign and organization of the Research Software Seminar Series. 

## Boardmeeting - monthly

The board of the association meets once every month.
(more info coming soon)

## Association meeting - yearly

Once every year all members of the Nordic RSE association are invited to the annual meeting.
(more info coming soon)
