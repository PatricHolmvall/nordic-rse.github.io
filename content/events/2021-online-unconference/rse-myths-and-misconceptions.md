# Myths and misconceptions about Research Software development in Academia

[Anne Fouilloux](https://github.com/annefou) (Nordic-RSE)

The goal is to explore and discuss myths and misconceptions about research
software development in academia and how these myths and misconceptions are
hindering the organization and recognition of Research software Engineers in
the Nordics. To initiate the discussion, we will provide a few examples such
as:

* Development of Research Software is not research.
* Research software is any code that has been written by a scientist.
* Anyone who has written (or even looked) at 3 lines of code is a qualified
  Research Software Engineer.
* Software is data so FAIR software==FAIR data.
