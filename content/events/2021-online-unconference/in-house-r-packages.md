# Developing and distributing in-house R-packages

[Athanasia Monika Mowinckel](https://drmowinckels.io/about/) (University of Oslo)

R is mainly a statistical programming language than has been around for more
than 20 years. In recent years, it has seen a large resurge in popularity,
especially amongst researchers, for its powerful statistical backbone and open
source practice. But R can be unfamiliar and intimidating for researchers used
to a purely GUI based statistical tool. This talk will center around how I have
developed in-house R tools to clean and handle in-house data, and how I have
distributed these to work on multiple platforms.
