# Nordic RSE Unconference 2021, June 29-30

## Dates: June 29-30, 13-16 CET (3 + 3 hours)

We are planning an online unconference on June 29–30. The program will consist
of **your contributions** and we encourage you to submit a short abstract for a
discussion topic, talk, demonstration, or any other type of program you would
like to run.


## Format and goal and scope

We will run an informal unconference to bring the community of research software
engineers together and to exchange ideas, solutions and challenges.
In the unconference format **we encourage participants to shape the program**.
We will provide support and infrastructure for that.

This event is not only limited to the Nordics and not only limited to participants
who are or identify as RSEs, but anybody interested in the interface of research, software, and data is welcome.


## What contributions we welcome

We welcome *any kind of contribution* which respects the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct). 
We will try to arrange a program based on your input.

Here are some examples of possible contributions:
- *Discussion topics*: is software, research software community or research software engineer something close to your heart? Come chatting with other enthusiasts!
- *Demonstrations:* show us some tools or softwares that you like
- *Workshop or [ReproHacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/)* (only 3 hours in a day)
- *Talks*: teach us something new 
- *On going projects*: share with others something unfinished and almost working where you would like to get feedback on
- *Something else*: something you would like to share with others that does not fit any of the previuous points? We are looking forward to hearing about it!
