# Keep your code alive - lessons from the QuTiP project

[Shahnawaz Ahmed](http://sahmed.in/) (Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology)

The Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) is a widely used tool for simulating
quantum physics. In this talk we will discuss QuTiP's journey from a Python
project started by two researchers, to a community of developers and users
spread all across the globe. The talk will focus on building an open-source
community and how QuTiP was kept alive through contributions from the
community, Google summer of Code and different academic and non-academic
funding opportunities.
