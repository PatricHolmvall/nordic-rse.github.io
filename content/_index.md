# Nordic research software engineers

A **research software engineer** is someone involved in research, but
more focused on the computational skills than publications.
**Nordic-RSE** is the network of these people in the Nordics and Baltics.  We
currently focus on building a network of RSEs and highlighting their
importance in the academic system.  For RSEs or people who might want to be one,
we offer opportunities for professional development and career
advancement.

We are modeled on similar international networks in the
[UK](https://rse.ac.uk), [Germany](https://de-rse.org),
[Netherlands](https://nl-rse.org/), [United
States](https://us-rse.org), and other countries.

To join us, fill in our [membership form](https://forms.gle/qCVVRGXPi3Hq7inW6).


### Unconference

We are planning an [online unconference](/events/2021-online-unconference) on June 29â€“30. The program will consist of your contributions and we encourage you to submit a short abstract for a discussion topic, talk, demonstration or any other type of program you would like to run.

### Biweekly meeting

We meet every other week to discuss the development of Nordic RSE and plan upcoming events. The meeting is on each odd week. Follow the [calendar](/events/#calendar), chat or agenda (see below) for exact dates and times.

The agendas of previous and upcoming meeting are kept on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@nordic-rse/biweekly).


### Want to know more?

- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nordic_rse).
- Discuss with other RSEs on the [CodeRefinery chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (#nordic-rse stream).
- Find great reading material at [UK RSE](https://rse.ac.uk) and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)!


### What is a research software engineer?

A growing number of people in academia **combine expertise in programming with an
intricate understanding of research**. Although this combination of skills is
extremely valuable, RSEs often lack a formal place in the academic
system: they may produce fewer first-author papers than a researcher,
and they may contribute to many papers and not appear as a
author beyond a minor acknowledgement, if that!
Their code is less
formal than a software developers', and career recognition is
correspondingly low.  The term "Research Software Engineer" is an attempt
to recognize and promote these people, and the [advantages to being a
RSE are similar to being a
researcher](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-08-23-ten-reasons-be-research-software-engineer).
RSEs will almost always closely work with researchers.

You can read more about RSEs demographics in the Nordics in [our 2018
survey](https://github.com/nordic-rse/RSE_intro_survey).


### Who we are

This is the website of the (unregistered) **Nordic Research Software
Engineers** association.  We do or want to do the following:

* We currently informally meet, talk, and plan events.
* Provide a community and professional development network for RSEs.
* Organize Nordic-RSE conference every two years
* Periodic community chats
* Assistance in starting RSE groups

We are still just beginning - if you have ideas for activities we
should organize, get in touch.

We are related to (but different from) the following other groups, and
share a chat platform with them:

* **[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)** is about teaching.
  Nordic-RSE has grown out of people involved in CodeRefinery, but
  CodeRefinery is not a major project of Nordic-RSE.

* **[Nordic HPC](https://nordichpc.github.io)** was an attempt to
  bring together people from computing facilities in the Nordics (not
  just HPC).  It is not very active now, and also a separate
  activity.


### Are you a research software engineer?

Most research software engineers don't have that as their job title.  If you answer yes to many of the following
questions, you are doing the work of a research software engineer:

- Are you employed to develop software for research?
- Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
- Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software development?
- Are you the person who write research software in your research group?
- Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
- Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers
  and conference presentations, despite having made a significant contribution
  through software?
