# The Association

The Nordic RSE group is planning to register in Finland as the Research Software Engineers Ry.
Registering as an association comes with certain legal benefits, such as the ability to
sign contracts and own assets.
Registering an association will also create a clear membership and governing
procedures.

The association is governed by an annual assembly of its members, which is held
mainly online, and its day to day activities are taken care of by a board.

# Membership

While the purpose of the association is to support research software engineering and
scientific computing, anyone can join as a member. The only requirement is that you
wish scientific software was more valued, better implemented, more open and FAIR.

The board of the association will decide annually if a membership fee is collected.

# Statutes

The statutes of the association can be found [here](/association/statutes).
