# RSE activities in Finland

The RSE Finland group is an active segment of Nordics-RSE.  Members come from
all corners of the Finnish scientific landscape and we are trying to help
researchers and others developing software for research by offering workshops
and a platform for information exchange in Finland.  For more
information about what we do, see [the general communities
page](/communities/join/).

To discuss matters concerning upcoming workshops in Finland, and also to get to
know each other better, we organize a **weekly virtual coffee break**, see
below. Everyone with an interest in the topic is warmly welcome to join :)


### Chat

Discuss with other RSEs on the [CodeRefinery
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (Join the #finland and
#nordic-rse streams using the gear icon by the steams list on the left side).
This is a public chat and everybody is welcome to join - whether to
suggest ideas or just listen.


### Weekly virtual coffee break

**There is no virtual coffee break on December 24th**

The RSE Finland group invites all interested in research software engineering
to the weekly online coffee break at **10:00** (Europe/Helsinki) **every Thursday**.  The coffee
break is an informal meeting, open for everyone to discuss with and listen to
others interested in research software engineering.  We currently have
no pre-decided topics, but never run out of things to say.

Language: English

Host: Jarno Rantaharju (Dept. of Physics, University of Helsinki)
