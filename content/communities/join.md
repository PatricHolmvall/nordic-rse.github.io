# Join us!

By joining the community, you will stay informed about our work
and will have the chance to contact people like you from all
corners of the research world. The more members that we have,
the easier it will be to prove the impact of the research software
engineering community and influence the decisions that affect us.

We are currently very informally organized.  If you want to do
something in our name, propose it on chat and plan it openly.  (We
would be happy to have someone lead some sort of periodic
talks/discussions, for example).


### Nordic-RSE chat

Our primary discussion is via the [CodeRefinery
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (#nordic-rse stream - join
by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side on that chat).  This is a
joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage).

This is a public chat and everybody is welcome to join. In this chat we
discuss RSE activities Nordics and you are most welcome to open new
"topic" threads, ask questions, and network.


### Follow us

- Follow us on [Twitter (nordic_rse)](https://twitter.com/nordic_rse).
- We will add an announcement email list soon.
- Add yourself to the [RSE map](/map/).


### Biweekly meetings

We meet every other week to discuss the development of Nordic RSE and
plan upcoming events. The meeting is on each odd week on Monday at 10 CET (11 EET).
Follow chat or agendas (see below) for exact dates.

The agendas of previous and upcoming meeting are kept on
