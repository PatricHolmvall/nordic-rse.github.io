# How we did our unconference

In June 2021, Nordic-RSE put on an
"[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)" event,
which basically means a more dynamic and attendee-driven event, rather
than fully organized by a closed program committee.  We didn't really
make it a "pure" unconference, since we did a little bit of planning
and inviting in advance.  Still, most of the program was decided
during the event itself, based on the participant's suggestions and
voting.

Our basic strategy for the unconference part was to start with a
Github issue tracker: people could suggest ideas there, already in
advance.  Everyone (not just the program committee) could comment,
help improve, and join forces to present.  During the event itself, we
could get a few more proposals, and use HackMD to get comments and
vote on what we wanted.  We did have one person responsible for
scheduling each day (benelovent dictator to get things done sooner).

Overall, the concept worked well enough.  Being the first time we
tried this, the largest problems were getting a shared understanding
of how it would work and get people to submit things.  It did achieve
the main goal of reducing the workload on the organizers to plan and
schedule everything in advance, with limited information.  We could
have had more submissions, but it is very possible that this is
expected for a new conference done right before and during summer
holidays.

In the future, we should have increased emphasis on encouraging people
to submit with a low threshold, since a public processes biases
towards people who already have great confidence.  This may be better
already by default the next time, but also some sort of mentoring
program could be helpful.  We should make sure that we have a clear
outreach approach to explain the format.

For future reference, our "planning notes" are included below.  Feel
free to use and try to improve!  Please let us know how it goes and
suggestions for improvements You can also read our notes (instead of
slides) used during the event itself:

## What is an unconference?

- Conference: pre-planned by an "elite" program committee
- Conference: large amount of preparation, often minimum threshold to contribute
- Unconference: provide tools for participants to drive the program more dynamically than usual.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference


## Why are we doing an unconference?

- Easier for us!
- More dynamic, especially for a small group.
- We want real ideas and discussions.  Advance planning by a program committee doesn't match that too well because it biases towards planned events.
- This isn't a "pure" unconference
  - We have some pre-scheduling
  - But we will try to make it dynamic as well



## Preparation

- Attendees can suggest sessions or ideas or even *requests for sessions* in advance
  - Attendees can vote on what they would like to see
  - ... and help other attendees develop their sessions, or join up to co-present
- Organizers try to highlight a few sessions and produce an initial schedule.
- All session proposals are copied into the unconference HackMD before the event


## During the event

- Attend sessions and discuss
- When you get an idea for something else to discuss or present, propose it!
  - Mention it where relevant: HackMD discussion of the current session
  - In the main unconference HackMD, in the "Proposed sessions" section.
- Vote up sessions you would like to attend with "+1" in the HackMD right after the session proposal.
- Organizers will try to keep track of this and periodically announce upcoming events and breakout room assignments
  - But you can also always follow the HackMD for the latest status.
  - Or you can grab a breakout room at any time.  HackMD can be used to try to attract people to it.


Think of this as "stick notes on a wall", which is used in in-person unconferences.  A sticky note is a proposal, people add notes and occassionally they get arranged into sessions, like this: ![Unconference sticky notes on a wall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Unconference_proposals_at_Google_Summer_of_Code_Mentor_Summit_2019.jpg/800px-Unconference_proposals_at_Google_Summer_of_Code_Mentor_Summit_2019.jpg)

## For sessions
- Realize that there are a wide variety of people attending and try to spend some time making sure everyone has a chance to talk
- Keep good HackMD notes, since not everyone who is interested can attend each session.  You might even get some contributors who are in another session but watching your HackMD.


## Notes

- In other unconferences, these sessions may be directly scheduled into slots.
  - Here, proposals can be added at any moment but organizers try to keep things organized.
- We don't have a limit on number of breakout rooms (well, 50), but we want to have enough people at each session.
- Anarchy vs democracy vs authororitarianism
  - Perhaps an ideal world is where everything comes from attendees
  - But we think that we need some organizers benevolently guiding the program to make it work well, for example a few pre-planned sessions.
  - Perhaps we need less of this once we become more comfortable with the format.


## To-do
- [ ] The schedule on the website says to look at HackMD for the latest assignments, etc.
- [ ] "check-in" sessions in main room added to schedule for use with summaries and announcing upcoming sessions.
- [ ] Main HackMD has sections for "Current schedule" and "Proposed sessions"
- [ ] Proposals transferred from issues into HackMD (linked to issues for ideas)
- [ ] Session chair knows what to do during the "check-in" sessions
