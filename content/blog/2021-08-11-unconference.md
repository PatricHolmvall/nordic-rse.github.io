# Unconference 2021

On June 29th + 30th 2021 the Nordic RSE community met online for an unconference. Three speakers were invited beforehand to talk about their interesting work, 
the rest of the event was free for the community to fill.
* Shahnawaz Ahmed from the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology talked about the journey of his Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) from small research project 
to open source project developed by a community from all around the world.
* Kristoffer Carlsson  from JuliaComputing introduced Julia for research software.
* Anne Fouilloux from Nordic-RSE gave some insights into myths and misconceptions about research software development in academia that she encountered during her work
as an RSE.
The event had 69 registrations from 7 countries (FI,NO,SE,DK,UK,DE,NL). 
Topics ranged from broad (Introduction to Julia, What is R/S/E?, ...) to specific ( Funding for software projects, Development frameworks, Software paper publishing,...) 
with lots of Q&A and discussions. You can find schedule and notes [here](https://nordic-rse.org/events/2021-online-unconference/#schedule) and stay tuned 
for blogposts and recordings of the invited talks coming in the near future.
