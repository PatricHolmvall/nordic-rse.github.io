# RSE activities in Finland

The RSE Finland group is an active segment of Nordics-RSE.  Members come from
all corners of the Finnish scientific landscape and we are trying to help
Researchers and others developing software for research by offering workshops
and a platform for information exchange in Finland.

To discuss matters concerning upcoming workshops in Finland, and also to get to
know each other better, we organize a **weekly virtual coffee break**, see
below. Everyone with an interest in the topic is warmly welcome to join :)


## Join the discussions

#### Chat

Discuss with other RSEs on the [CodeRefinery
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) (Join the #finland and possibly
#nordic-rse streams using the gear icon by the steams list on the left side).
This is a public chat and everybody is welcome to join. This is the place where
we discuss RSE events in the Nordics and you are most welcome to open new
"topic" threads, ask questions, and network. Here you can also find a finland
stream.


#### Weekly virtual coffee break

The RSE Finland group invites all interested in research software engineering
to the weekly online coffee break at **10 o'clock every Thursday**.  The coffee
break is an informal meeting, open for everyone to discuss with and listen to
others interested in research software engineering.

Language: according to participants preferences (mostly English)

Host: Jarno Rantaharju (Dept. of Physics, University of Helsinki)
