## Volunteering

We are looking for volunteers!

We are looking for people who would like to get involved and help out
supporting sessions and workshops as volunteers.

It is a great way to meet peers from the RSE community and to support the
Nordic RSE community and this conference.

Please get in touch with the [conference organizers](mailto:nordic-rse-organizers@neic.no)
if you would like to contribute as volunteer helper.
