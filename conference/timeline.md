# Important dates

Below we list important dates and milestones on the way to the first Nordic-RSE
conference.


### COVID-19 decision timeline

We in the [organizing committee](/conference/team/) are and will be very
careful about minimizing health risk for all participants and those affected by
participants who travel to the event.
We will be closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Sweden and other
countries so that we can decide whether this event can take place in person
December 1-2, 2020. We will not just consider if we *are allowed to* host
this conference, but if it is *responsible* to host it.

Below we share our timeline to decide whether this event can take place.
Do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:nordic-rse-organizers@neic.no) if you
have questions or suggestions about this aspect.


### What happens if we postpone?

- All registrants will be notified by email
- We will reimburse registration payments
- We will postpone the event to 2021 (at this point we are not planning an online substitute, but our online community-building, including smaller meetings, will continue regardless)
