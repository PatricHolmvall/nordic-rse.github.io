# The first Nordic-RSE conference will take place **December 1-2, 2020, in Stockholm**.

Initially we have planned for October 21-22, 2020, but due to uncertainties
around the COVID-19 situation we decided to move the conference to December,
still Stockholm.  We will of course continue monitoring the situation in the
coming months.
