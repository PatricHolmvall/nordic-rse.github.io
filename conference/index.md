# The first Nordic-RSE conference will take place **December 1-2, 2020, in Stockholm**.

Initially we have planned for October 21-22, 2020, but due to uncertainties
around the COVID-19 situation we decided to move the conference to December,
still Stockholm.  We will of course continue monitoring the situation in the
coming months.


## Why attending the conference and why getting involved?

When planning this conference we have the following "personas" in mind:

- **People who spend a significant portion of their time programming**
    - These are "classic" RSEs
    - Their goals:
      - Get recognized for their work
    - Their interests:
      - Best practices
      - Future career possibilities
      - Collaboration opportunities
- **People with research focus who spend one or two hours per week programming**
    - Their goals:
      - More efficient research
    - Their interests:
      - Solve immediate problems
      - Learn about best software practices in their domain
- **PIs/administrators who can improve their institution's research quality**
    - Their goals:
      - Learn how to organize their research staff to do research better
    - Their interests:
      - Learn about lessons learned from other groups and institutions
