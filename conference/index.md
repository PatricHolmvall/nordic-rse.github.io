# The first Nordic-RSE conference will take place **December 1-2, 2020, in Stockholm**.

Initially we have planned for October 21-22, 2020, but due to uncertainties
around the COVID-19 situation we decided to move the conference to December,
still Stockholm.  We will of course continue monitoring the situation in the
coming months.


## Venue

The venue is the **student union building "Nymble"** in Drottning Kristinas v√§g 15,
Stockholm. This venue has sufficient capacity for 200 people, one large room
and several smaller rooms.  It is located on KTH campus, offers good open
informal areas for mingling during coffee breaks, not a "sterile" conference
venue but has an atmosphere.
