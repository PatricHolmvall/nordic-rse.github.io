# Submit a proposal


### COVID-19 statement

The organisers hope to be able to proceed with running
the Nordic-RSE conference, as planned, in Stockholm on December 1-2.
However, with the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we are aware that this relies on
there being a continuing improvement in the situation over the coming months.
It is also likely that social distancing measures will have some effect on our
plans for the conference and full details will be advised nearer to the
conference. We encourage you to go ahead with making a submission to the
conference but urge you not to make any travel bookings that are non-refundable
at this stage ([COVID-19 decision timeline](/conference/timeline/)).


### Types of proposals

We welcome any type of proposal for this conference.  This is the
first Nordic-RSE meeting, so we especially welcome a variety of event
types which promote engagement and community building, and are target
to people who don't already identify as RSEs.

Our venue is the KTH Student Union ([more details about the venue](/conference/practical/#venue)),
and will have lots of places for
informal discussions or close interactions.  But not *too* close,
since COVID-19 isn't going away.

We aim for recording and streaming, but the process is not yet decided
and this is not required if you don't feel comfortable or it isn't
suitable.  However, we are still aiming for an in-person event, since
online can't serve the same purpose of building a new community (but
would be glad to have hybrid online/in person events proposed).


### Timeline and process

Submission opens at the end of July and is planned to close on
September 9.  Submissions should consist of ~150 word abstract for
shorter talks, and ~250 words for longer talks.  There will be a
review round, and notifications of acceptance will be sent in
mid-October (see [the full timeline](/conference/timeline/)).

The submissions will be reviewed by the [program committee](/conference/team/).
The identities of submitters will not be revealed to the reviewers during
review, but also the identities of reviewers are not revealed. The person or
persons who anonymize the identities of submitters and reviewers will not take
part in the review itself.

TODO: how to submit.


### Themes

We don't have pre-determined tracks, but we propose that the following
themes would be interesting to attendees.  Also, consider the types of
attendees we expect on the [front page](/conference/).

- Tools and training for computational researchers and RSEs.  Stuff
  that people should learn.  It doesn't have to be solely directed at
  people who consider themselves RSEs.
- How to run a RSE group.  How to hire RSEs.
- RSE career tracks in the Nordics.
- Information to funders and administrators to support RSE programs.
- Community impact and engagement.
- Teaching and training.
- Infrastructure.

Please don't feel limited to classic lectures - we will consider any
kind of event, such as discussions, networking sessions, hackthons,
workshops, art exhibits, games, contests, etc.  Our primary categories
to fill, though, are **plenary**, **talk/workshop**, **lightning
talk**, **poster or exhibit**.  Plenaries are 30-45 minutes,
talks/workshops sessions are up to 1.5 hours in a session (but could
span multiple sessions).  See [the tentative
schedule](/conference/schedule/) for how you might fit in.

We don't plan for satellites, but if you know someone who can reserve
space in Stockholm, we can try to coordinate.
