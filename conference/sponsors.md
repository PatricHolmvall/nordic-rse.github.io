# Call for sponsors

### Why sponsor the Nordic-RSE conference?

The Nordic-RSE conference is the first conference of its kind in the Nordics.
It is modeled after the successful conferences that took place in the UK,
Netherlands, and Germany.

We expect a diverse audience of around 200 research software engineers,
decision makers, research funders, research scholars and early career
researchers to attend this event.

A sponsorship of the Nordic-RSE conference is therefore an ideal opportunity to
introduce solutions and services to the young and growing research software
community in the Nordics and beyond.

Sponsors also allow for a more heterogeneous and inclusive conference audience
by helping us keep registration fees low through their financial support.
