# RSE community in Nordic countries

Research software engineering groups provide a home for research programmers
who collaborate with researchers on multiple research projects.

With the goal create a network of RSEs across Nordic countries we are
interested in listing RSE groups, teams, and local research organizations
communities.  They may be based in universities or in national labs or research
institutes, and in academic departments or in university IT organisations.
